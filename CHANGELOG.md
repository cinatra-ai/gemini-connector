## 0.1.3
- Converted the connector to the schema-config surface: configuration renders from a declared config schema instead of a custom React page, configuring fully at runtime with no image rebuild.
- Declared the connector's supported Cinatra SDK ABI range.
- Removed the extension-rendered connection-status pill.
- Re-publishing restores the connector's registry metadata that a prior publisher bug had stripped, fixing installation.
